## My Github
My github contains projects that I've done myself personally to practice & gain experience working with Data in different tasks including Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
The projects are conducted either in Python or R, most of them are compiled in Jupyter Notebooks format.
Feel free to let me know if there's anything that I can further improve !
